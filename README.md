# CPIT305 Course Project - "Hotel Booking System"
To begin with, our main idea is to make a system to book a hotel room from the receptionist ( Client ). The customer will ask to book a room and the receptionist will check empty rooms. Our system ( Server ) will show available rooms to the receptionist.

## About "Hotel Booking System":
Our system will ask the receptionist to enter the username and password. If it is wrong, the system will not make the receptionist enter the system. After that, the receptionist will see the main menu which gives him 6 options which are: 
- List all rooms
- Update room
- Search by room number
- Show avaliable rooms
- Set room to default 
- Exit

"List all rooms": 
will make the receptionist see all the rooms with its information(Room number, Room type, Visitor name, check in, check out, state)
Note : State of the room means if the room is taken or not. 
1 = Not taken.
0 = Taken.

"Update room": will change the information of the room and will set the room state to taken. 
Note : Receptionist must not put a space between names and do the same format for check in and out.

"Search by room number": will show the inserted information of the wanted room. 

"Show avaliable rooms": will show all the rooms that have "not taken" state.

"Set room to default": will reset the room information.

"Exit": will make the receptionist exit the system.
