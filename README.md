# CPIT305 Course Project
## More details about your project
There are many titles that can fit with our system but we prefer to stick with the name "Booking Management System". Most parts of the project will be implemented and checked together but we will distribute the work and each one of us will focus on a topic. Rakan will focus on streamfiles and database, Abdulrahman will focus on multithreading and exeptions, and Moath will focus on network programming. Our system will come into use  when a customer asks the receptionist for a room. The system will show the receptionist available rooms with their details ( room type, price, and information about the room). After the customer chooses a room and completes payment, the receptionist will book the room and add customer information to that room. After this process, the database will be updated.

## About "Hotel Booking System":
Our system will ask the receptionist to enter the username and password. If it is wrong, the system will not make the receptionist enter the system. After that, the receptionist will see the main menu which gives him 6 options which are: 
- List all rooms
- Update room
- Search by room number
- Show avaliable rooms
- Set room to default 
- Exit

"List all rooms": 
will make the receptionist see all the rooms with its information(Room number, Room type, Visitor name, check in, check out, state)
Note : State of the room means if the room is taken or not. 
1 = Not taken.
0 = Taken.

"Update room": will change the information of the room and will set the room state to taken. 
Note : Receptionist must not put a space between names and do the same format for check in and out.

"Search by room number": will show the inserted information of the wanted room. 

"Show avaliable rooms": will show all the rooms that have "not taken" state.

"Set room to default": will reset the room information.

"Exit": will make the receptionist exit the system.
