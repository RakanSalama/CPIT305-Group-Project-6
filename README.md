# CPIT305 Course Project
To begin with, our main idea is to make a system to book a hotel room from the receptionist. The customer will ask to book a room and the receptionist will check empty rooms. Our system will show available rooms to the receptionist and give the choice to the customer to choose one of them.

## More details about your project
There are many titles that can fit with our system but we prefer to stick with the name "Booking Management System". Most parts of the project will be implemented and checked together but we will distribute the work and each one of us will focus on a topic. Rakan will focus on streamfiles and database, Abdulrahman will focus on multithreading and exeptions, and Moath will focus on network programming. Our system will come into use  when a customer asks the receptionist for a room. The system will show the receptionist available rooms with their details ( room type, price, and information about the room). After the customer chooses a room and completes payment, the receptionist will book the room and add customer information to that room. After this process, the database will be updated.
